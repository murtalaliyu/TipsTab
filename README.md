# TipsTab
Built a google Chrome extension that shows JavaScript tips in new tabs by following the instructions on Codecademy.

"Make sure to save your JavaScript Tips Tab folder in a location where you can find it (like Documents or Desktop).  Open a new tab, and navigate to chrome://extensions. Inside this tab, click on the Developer Mode checkbox in the top right corner. Once that is checked, some buttons will appear. Click on Load Unpacked Extension... This will open up a file browser. Navigate to your JavaScript Tips Tab project folder and select it. This enables the extension." - (excerpts from https://medium.com/@codecademy/javascript-tips-tab-4e9081b4132)
